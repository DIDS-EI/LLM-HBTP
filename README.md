## ðŸ”§ Installation

Create and activate a new Conda environment:

```shell
conda create --name btgym python=3.9
conda activate btgym
```

Install BTGym:

```shell
cd BTGym
pip install -e .
```

Download the VirtualHome executable for your operating system (currently tested on Windows):

| Operating System | Download Link                                                |
| :--------------- | :----------------------------------------------------------- |
| Linux            | [Download](http://virtual-home.org/release/simulator/v2.0/v2.3.0/linux_exec.zip) |
| MacOS            | [Download](http://virtual-home.org/release/simulator/v2.0/v2.3.0/macos_exec.zip) |
| Windows          | [Download](http://virtual-home.org/release/simulator/v2.0/v2.3.0/windows_exec.zip) |

## ðŸš€ Usage

1. Download the Windows version of the simulator:
   - [Download Simulator](http://virtual-home.org/release/simulator/v2.0/v2.3.0/windows_exec.zip)
2. Unzip the downloaded files and move them to `simulators/virtualhome/windows`.
3. Execute `watch_tv.py` to view the simulation:
   ```python
   python test/watch_tv.py
   ```
4. Execute `VHT_main.py` to see the results from the LLM-HOBTEA framework:
   ```python
   python test/VHT_main.py
   ```

These modifications include the addition of relevant icons to each section header for better visual distinction and to match the content topics more closely.
